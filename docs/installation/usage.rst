Basic Usage
-----------

`vs-kernels` is a Python module,
meaning it must be imported into your script before it can be accessed.
You can import it by doing the following:

.. code-block:: py

    import vskernels as kernels

With the module now imported,
you can call functions in your script by referencing the module
and writing a function name behind it.

.. code-block:: py

    import vskernels as kernel

    kernels.get_kernel()
